# hotplugins
Welcome!

This code contains simple implementation of hot-swap plugins loading system.

This is my R&D results of learning low level JVM file formats and class loaders.
JVM documentation can be found here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html

Please feel free to use my code on any goals.
